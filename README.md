# NorESM2.2 documentation
NorESM2.2 is an experimental version of NorESM, mainly intended for testing NorESM with capabilities that are available in the upstream CESM2.1 version. 
For normal operation it is strongly encouraged to use only the scientifically validated configurations available in NorESM2.0. 
Please get in touch with the NorESM development team, e.g. through the NorESM discussions page, if you would like to use the NorESM2.2 version in your own work.
