Welcome to the NorESM documentation pages!
==========================================

NorESM has been developed since 2007, and has served as a common platform for contributions from the Norwegian research community to the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
These documentation pages provide information about NorESM at key stages of development, as well as recent updates to the model system.
For this reason, separate documentation pages are provided for the different model versions.


Documentation of NorESM model versions
--------------------------------------

NorESM versions, similarly to the upstream CESM project, come in two flavors, scientifically supported and validated versions and experimental development versions.
For most use cases, the scientifically supported versions are preferable, being both better tested and documented.


Scientifically supported NorESM versions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

`NorESM1 <https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm1/>`_ :
   Model version used for CMIP5 and IPCC AR5.
   NorESM1 is based on the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4.0) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.0.3).
   The latest code release is `noresm 1 <https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/releases/tag/1.0.0>`_, from December 19, 2018.

`NorESM2 <https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2/>`_ :
   Model version used for CMIP6 and IPCC AR6.
   NorESM2 is based on the Community Earth System Model (`CESM2.1 <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2>`_).
   The latest code release is `noresm2.0.9 <https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/releases/tag/release-noresm2.0.9>`_, from October 2024.


Unsupported development versions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

`NorESM2.1 <https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2.1/>`_ :
   Bugfix version that fixes some known bugs in NorESM2. This is a technical release that does not include model tuning for a balanced climate output.

`NorESM2.2 <https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm2.2/>`_ :
   Experimental development version based on CESM2.2.


Low-key discussion forum
---------------------------
If you have a question or you canâ€™t find the solution to a problem in the documentation, please post your question here: https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/discussions


How to get information about NorESM events
------------------------------------------
For obtaining news per email register to noresm-community@met.no (see instructions at https://www.noresm.org or via `this link <https://www.noresm.org/contact/#newsletter>`_).


The NorESM Land Sites Platform (LSP)
------------------------------------
The `NorESM-LSP <https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/>`_ software allows anyone to run simple, offline, single-site simulations with the NorESM-CLM-FATES model. It is useful for beginners, or in education, to get started with the model without access to an HPC. See the NorESM-LSP's `scientific paper <https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16808>`_, `user guide and documentation webpage <https://noresmhub.github.io/noresm-land-sites-platform/>`_, and `main GitHub repository <https://github.com/NorESMhub/noresm-land-sites-platform>`_ for more information.
