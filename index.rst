Welcome to the NorESM documentation pages!
==========================================

NorESM has been developed since 2007, and has served as a common platform for contributions from the Norwegian research community to the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
These documentation pages provide information about NorESM at key stages of development, as well as recent updates to the model system.
For this reason, separate documentation pages are provided for the different model versions.


Documentation of NorESM model versions
--------------------------------------

NorESM versions, similarly to the upstream CESM project, come in two flavors, scientifically supported and validated versions and experimental development versions.
For most use cases, the scientifically supported versions are preferable, being both better tested and documented.


Scientifically supported NorESM versions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

`NorESM1 <https://noresm-docs.readthedocs.io/en/noresm1/>`_ :
   Model version used for CMIP5 and IPCC AR5.
   NorESM1 is based on the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4.0) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.0.3).
   The latest code release is `noresm 1 <https://github.com/NorESMhub/NorESM/releases/tag/1.0.0>`_, from December 19, 2018.
