Welcome to NorESM1 documentation!
================================================

NorESM1 is the Norwegian Earth System model used for CMIP5. The model is based on the CCSM framework (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Climate_System_Model). However, NorESM has special features developed by Norwegian researchers. 

The purpose of the NorESM1 documentation is to provide a common place for NorESM users
and developers to share information. 

- What tools are you using? 
- Which version should I run for what purpose? etc.

NorESM version 2 documentation is found here:
