Welcome to the NorESM documentation pages!
==========================================

The NorESM2.5 version will introduce major structural and component changes comapred to earlier NorESM2.X versions.

The NorESM2.5 documentation is currently intended to aid the model development.

New user guide instructions will be included at a later stage, when we have achieved a stable NorESM2.5 code base.
